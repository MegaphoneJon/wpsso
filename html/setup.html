<dt><h3>Business Social Accounts (Optional)</h3></dt>

<dd>

<p>If you haven't already done so, create a Facebook Page and Twitter account for your business / website. You can enter all your business / website social account information in the <em><strong>SSO &gt; Social Pages</strong></em> settings page. The social account URLs are used by WPSSO Core for Open Graph and Schema meta tag values, along with Schema Organization markup in JSON-LD format (which may appear in Google Search results to highlight your business / website social pages).</p>

</dd>

<dt><h3>Author Social Accounts (Optional)</h3></dt>

<dd>

<p>Ask your content authors to enter their Facebook and Twitter contact information in their WordPress user profile page. Each author's contact information can appear in various meta tags and Schema JSON-LD markup for Facebook, Twitter, and Google, <em>but only if they complete their user profile</em>.</p>

</dd>

<dt><h3>Review Essential Settings</h3></dt>

<dd>

<p>Review the website description on the <em><strong>SSO &gt; Essential Settings</strong></em> page and select a default image ID or URL. The default image is used for index / archive pages, and as a fallback for posts and pages that do not have a suitable custom image, featured image, attached image, or an image available in their content.</p>

<p><strong>Do not forget to submit a few example posts / pages to the validation tools mentioned below.</strong> Some markup formats, like Pinterest Rich Pins, must be requested / enabled when submitting an example post / page to their validation tool.</p>

</dd>

<dt><h3>Keep an Eye on Notifications</h3></dt>

<dd>

<p>WPSSO Core and its complementary add-ons attempt to keep notifications to a minimum, issuing only informational, warning, or error notifications when required. Messages from the default WordPress notication system can feel intrusive and over-used, and are not compatible with the new block editor in WordPress v5, so WPSSO Core includes its own (more discreet) notification system in the top toolbar.</p>

<p>Look for the SSO notification icon in the top toolbar - by default, it will be grey with a 0 notification count. If there are notifications, the count will increase, and the SSO icon be shown on a red, yellow, or blue background. WPSSO notifications are context sensitive - they relate to the content shown in the current webpage.</p>

<dt><h3>Schema Markup vs Google Rich Results</h3></dt>

<dd>

<p>Schema (aka "Schema.org") is a collaborative, community lead standard for structured data markup. Schema markup is classified by type, and each type is associated with a set of properties. The types are arranged in a hierarchy and <a href="https://schema.org/docs/schemas.html">the current Schema vocabulary consists of 779 types and 1390 properties</a>. The Schema vocabulary can be used with many different encodings, including meta tags, RDFa, Microdata, and JSON-LD. WPSSO Core adds Schema markup to webpages using meta tags for Pinterest and other social crawlers. The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-schema-json-ld/">WPSSO Schema JSON-LD Markup add-on</a> is required to provide additional markup using JSON-LD encoding for Google and other search engines.</p>

<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data">Google Rich Results are a set of requirements for a small selection of Schema types</a>, which includes specific images dimensions, a limited set of values for some Schema properties, limited Schema types for some property relations, and more. Google Rich Results require several layers of related markup (aka a multi-dimensional arrays) that must be expressed using JSON-LD in the webpage head section (preferred by Google), or with RDFa / Microdata markup in theme templates (deprecated standards).</p>

<p>If your theme templates do not provide RDFa / Microdata markup for Google Rich Results, you should enable the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-schema-json-ld/">WPSSO Schema JSON-LD Markup add-on</a>. If your theme templates include incomplete or incorrect RDFa / Microdata markup (a common problem), you should enable both the WPSSO Schema JSON-LD Markup add-on and the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-strip-schema-microdata/">WPSSO Strip Schema Microdata add-on</a> to also remove the incomplete or incorrect Microdata markup.</p>

<p><strong>Not sure if your theme templates already provide markup for Google rich results?</strong> Submit a post or page URL from your website to the <a href="https://search.google.com/test/rich-results">Google Rich Results Test Tool</a> or the <a href="https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool/u/0/">Google Structured Data Test Tool</a>, and compare the results before / after enabling the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-schema-json-ld/">WPSSO Schema JSON-LD Markup add-on</a>. Between checks, don't forget to clear the cache of any caching plugin or service you may be using, along with clearing the WPSSO cache in the <em><strong>SSO &gt; Tools and Actions</strong></em> settings page. ;-)</p>

</dd>

<img src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso/images/facebook-sharing-debugger.png" class="alignright">

<dt><h3>Validation Tools</h3></dt>

<dd>

<p>Submit a few sample posts, pages, etc. to the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/">Facebook Sharing Debugger</a> to verify your Open Graph meta tags. A link to the Facebook debugger is available under the Validate tab in the Document SSO metabox (on post, term, and user editing pages). Submitting a URL to the Facebook debugger can also be used to clear Facebook's cache (after clicking the "Fetch new scrape information" button). If you're validating older posts / pages, pre-dating the activation of WPSSO Core, note that <a href="https://wpsso.com/docs/plugins/wpsso/faqs/why-does-facebook-show-the-wrong-image-text/">Facebook may continue to use the old meta tag values from its cache</a>, even after fetching the new scrape information.</p>

<p>Submit an example post or page to the <a href="http://developers.pinterest.com/rich_pins/validator/">Pinterest Rich Pins Validator</a>. Note that the Pinterest validator recognizes only known Rich Pin types (article, recipe, product, etc.) - your home page and WordPress archive pages are generally not valid Rich Pin types. If you haven't already requested Rich Pin approval from Pinterest for your website, you can submit a request when validating your first example post or page.</p>

<img src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso/images/google-structured-data-testing-tool.png" class="alignright">

<p>If you have activated the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-schema-json-ld/">WPSSO Schema JSON-LD Markup add-on</a>, you can also submit URLs to the <a href="https://search.google.com/test/rich-results">Google Rich Results Test Tool</a> or the <a href="https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool/u/0/">Google Structured Data Test Tool</a>. WPSSO Core includes all the meta tags that social sites need, along with Schema markup for Google's Knowledge Graph in the site home page, but to create Schema markup for your post / page content, you must activate the WPSSO Schema JSON-LD Markup add-on. Some Schema types may also require additional organization and/or location information from the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-organization/">WPSSO Organization Markup add-on</a> and/or <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-plm/">WPSSO Place and Local SEO Markup add-on</a>.</p>

<p>Submit a few index / archive webpages and post / page URLs to the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C Markup Validator</a> to verify the HTML of your theme templates. Social and search engine crawlers expect properly formatted HTML that conforms to current HTML / XHTML standards. If your webpages contain serious HTML markup errors, social and search crawlers may be unable to read your meta tags and Schema markup. You should report any template HTML markup errors to your theme author.</p>

<dt><h3>User Interface and General Usage</h3></dt>

<dd>

<p>On most WordPress admin pages you'll find a "Screen Options" drop-down tab on the upper right-hand side of the page. You can use these screen options to include / exclude specific metaboxes and columns from the current page. For example, when viewing the posts or pages list you can use the "Screen Options" drop-down to hide / view the "Schema" and "SSO Image" columns. You can also enable / disable these columns globally under the <em><strong>SSO &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; Interface</strong></em> tab.</p>

<p>When editing a post, page, category, tag, user profile, etc., you'll find a Document SSO metabox below the content area where you can customize default texts, images, and videos. The Document SSO metabox shows a different set of options based on the content type selected (ie. Schema type or Open Graph type), allowing you to customize the details of articles, events, e-Commerce products, recipes, reviews, and more. The "Preview" tab shows how this webpage might look when shared on Facebook, the "Head Markup" tab shows a complete list of meta tags and Schema markup created by the WPSSO Core plugin and its add-ons, and the "Validate" tab allows you to submit the current webpage URL to several test and validation tools (mentioned above).</p>

<h4>BuddyPress Integration</h4>

<p>BuddyPress was not originally created as a WordPress plugin, and consequently BuddyPress is not well integrated with WordPress features and functions. There are specific <a href="https://wpsso.com/docs/plugins/wpsso/installation/integration/buddypress-integration/">BuddyPress Integration Notes</a> available to help you with some known BuddyPress integration issues.</p>

<h4>WooCommerce Integration</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://wpsso.com/docs/plugins/wpsso/installation/integration/woocommerce-integration/">WooCommerce Integration Notes</a> are very useful if you would like to include additional product information in your meta tags and Schema markup, like the product brand, color, condition, material, size, etc.</p>

<p><strong>The WooCommerce plugin is known to offer incomplete Schema markup for Google Rich Results.</strong> The <a href="https://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso/">WPSSO Core Premium plugin</a> and its <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-schema-json-ld/">WPSSO Schema JSON-LD Markup add-on</a> provide a much better solution by offering complete product meta tags for Facebook / Pinterest, and complete Schema product markup for Google Rich Results &mdash; including additional product images, product variations, product information (brand, color, condition, EAN, dimensions, GTIN-8/12/13/14, ISBN, material, MPN, size, SKU, volume, weight, etc), product reviews, product ratings, sale start / end dates, sale prices, pre-tax prices, VAT prices, shipping rates, shipping times, and much, much more.</p>
