<p>BuddyPress was not originally created as a WordPress plugin, and is not well integrated with WordPress features and functions. For example, BuddyPress does not register custom post types with WordPress, does not store images in the WordPress Media Library, or provide members access to their Biographical Info in the WordPress user profile. These integration issues lead to some limitations that can take a bit of effort to overcome.</p>

<h3>BuddyPress Avatar and Group Images</h3>

<p>By default, member avatars are provided by <a href="http://gravatar.com/">Gravatar</a>. WPSSO Core Premium recognizes Gravatar URLs, and can include Gravatar images of the correct dimensions in meta tags and Schema markup. If a member <em>changes</em> their default avatar image, or an avatar image is assigned for a group, BuddyPress will save those images with a dimension of 150x150px (by default). This is much too small for Facebook and other social websites to use when a member or group webpage is shared. To include the custom BuddyPress member and group images in the webpage meta tags, you must adjust the BuddyPress full size image dimensions.</p>

<p>Add the following to your bp-custom.php file, and increase the default <code>BP_AVATAR_FULL_WIDTH</code> and <code>BP_AVATAR_FULL_HEIGHT</code> from 150 to 200 or more (larger is better). See the <a href="https://codex.buddypress.org/themes/guides/customizing-buddypress-avatars/">Customizing BuddyPress Avatars</a> guide for additional information.</p>

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">
if ( ! defined( 'BP_AVATAR_FULL_WIDTH' ) ) {

    define( 'BP_AVATAR_FULL_WIDTH', 200 );
}

if ( ! defined( 'BP_AVATAR_FULL_HEIGHT' ) ) {

    define( 'BP_AVATAR_FULL_HEIGHT', 200 );
}
</pre>

<h3>BuddyPress Member Biographical Info</h3>

<p>The BuddyPress member profile page does not include the WordPress Biographical Info text from the WordPress user profile. If you've created an additional BuddyPress Profile Field for members, enter the field name in the BuddyPress Member Bio Field Name option under the <em>SSO &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; Integration</em> tab (example: Biographical Info, About Me, etc.).</p>
