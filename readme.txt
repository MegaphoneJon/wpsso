<p><strong>Uses WordPress, plugin, and remote API data:</strong></p>

There's no need to select or create templates, manually reenter descriptions, titles, product information, or reselect images and videos.

WPSSO can use your existing WordPress content, including custom post types and taxonomies, enhanced user profile data, Media Library image and video information, third-party plugin data, and remote service APIs (Bitly, Facebook, Shopper Approved, Stamped.io, Vimeo, Wistia, YouTube, and many more).

<p><strong>Supports over 500 different Schema types:</strong></p>

WPSSO provides comprehensive Schema markup for posts, pages, custom post types, terms (category, tags, etc.), custom taxonomies, user profile pages, search result pages, archive pages, and Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) pages - including image SEO, video SEO, local business, organization, publisher, person, author and co-authors, extensive e-Commerce product markup, product variations, product ratings, aggregate ratings, reviews, recipe information, event details, collection pages, profile pages, search pages, FAQ pages, item lists for Google's Rich Results Carousel, and much more.
