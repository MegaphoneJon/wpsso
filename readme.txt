**Stop messing around with Schema markup and manually updating social meta data. Save time and boost your social shares and SEO with WPSSO, the only WordPress solution to automatically generate meta tags *and* Schema markup.**

WPSSO analyzes your existing site content to create complete and accurate meta tags for all the popular social media platforms, as well as [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) markup for Pinterest and search engines.

Not only will using WPSSO significantly improve how your content is displayed in search results and on social platforms, but it will make it easier for people to find you.

<h3>Why Use WPSSO?</h3>

WPSSO takes the tedious work out of manually updating titles, descriptions and images for your Facebook and Twitter posts, and other social platforms.

It also combs through your site, generating titles, descriptions, hashtags, image, and Knowledge Graph markup, ensuring your content always looks its best in search results. WPSSO Core Pro and its Pro add-ons also integrate with 3rd party plugins to provide video, eCommerce product and local business markup, reviews, recipe, event information and more.

Simply activate the plugin, fill in the essential settings for your site and social accounts, and WPSSO will take care of the rest. You'll never have to worry about how your social posts and search engine results look ever again.

<h4>What is Social Meta Data?</h4>

Facebook Open Graph, Twitter Cards and Pinterest Rich Pins provide site owners a way to control how your content looks on these platforms. This means thumbnail, title, and description information is pulled from your webpage and displayed on these social sites.

<h4>What is Schema Markup?</h4>

Back in 2015, Google, Bing and Yahoo got together to create [Schema.org](https://schema.org/), a collection of Schema to help site owners control how their content looks in search. In other words, code that site owners can use to tell search engines what to do with the data on your website.

Web pages that have Schema markup display as rich snippets in Google, complete with extra information such as reviews with star ratings and images. With WPSSO Core Pro, you can also display event and business information and product information, like prices, availability, condition, etc.

<h3>Does Your Content Look Great in Social and Search?</h3>

What do your posts look like on Facebook? Are your reviews optimized for Google and include star ratings? Do your tweets pull in images?

If you're overlooking these not-so-minor details, you could be missing out on valuable clicks and conversions.

We all know the benefits of publishing and scheduling content. But if your titles are boring, descriptions dull, and images too small or non-existent, users will simply scroll past and click through to your competitor.

**WPSSO is the only plugin that offers quality control features for meta tags and schema, checking for:**

* Minimum and maximum image dimensions and aspect ratios.
* Shows notices for missing and required images.
* Verifies front-end web pages for duplicate meta tags.
* Validates theme header templates for correct HTML markup.
* Warns of any missing PHP modules essential for proper markup.
* Inspects third party plugins settings for possible conflicts.

<h3>Users Love WPSSO Core</h3>

&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; &mdash; "Yoast on steroids! As an SEO marketer, I love using Yoast for my basic on-page SEO. But Yoast only allows you to enter basic Open Graph social settings. This plugin gives you SO many more options on completing the Open Graph for Facebook, Twitter cards, Pinterest etc. If you use WordPress, I totally recommend using this SEO plugin to help with better rankings in the SERPS!" - [gregmontag](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/yoast-on-steroids/)
