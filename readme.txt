<h3 class="top">THE MOST ADVANCED STRUCTURED DATA PLUGIN FOR WORDPRESS</h3>

<p><img class="readme-icon" src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso/assets/icon-256x256.png"><strong>WPSSO helps you rank higher and improves click-through-rates by presenting your content at its best on social sites and in search results - no matter how URLs are shared, re-shared, messaged, posted, embedded, or crawled.</strong></p>

<p><strong>WPSSO provides meta tags and structured data markup for:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Facebook / Open Graph</li>
	<li>Google Knowledge Graph</li>
	<li>Google Rich Results (aka Rich Snippets)</li>
	<li>LinkedIn / oEmbed Data</li>
	<li>Mobile Web Browsers</li>
	<li>Pinterest Rich Pins</li>
	<li>Twitter Cards</li>
	<li>Schema.org Markup (for 500+ Schema Types)</li>
	<li>WhatsApp and Messaging Apps</li>
	<li>WordPress REST API and More!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>WPSSO reads existing content, plugin, and service API data:</strong></p>

There's no need to manually re-enter descriptions, titles, product information, or re-select images and videos! WPSSO can read your existing WordPress content, plugin data, and fetch data from remote service APIs (Bitly, Facebook, Shopper Approved, Stamped.io, Vimeo, Wistia, YouTube, and many more).

WPSSO can be your only social and search optimization plugin, or combined to improve the structured data of another SEO plugin (like All in One SEO Pack, Jetpack SEO Tools, Rank Math SEO, SEO Ultimate, SEOPress, The SEO Framework, WP Meta SEO, Yoast SEO, and more).

<p><strong>WPSSO is FAST, reliable, and coded for performance:</strong></p>

<p>WPSSO is coded for SPEED and QUALITY ASSURANCE with advanced caching techniques, media optimization (ie. image and video SEO, 1:1, 4:3, and 16:9 images for Google, etc.), template validations, discreet contextual notices, and much more.</p>

<p>No cartoons or fancy marketing - just fast and reliable code. &#x1F609;</p>
