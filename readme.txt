<h3 class="top">What makes WPSSO Core better?</h3>

**Makes sure your content looks great on all sites - no matter how it's crawled, shared, re-shared, posted, or embedded!**

WPSSO Core makes sure ALL social crawlers, search crawlers, web browser extensions, mail and messaging apps (Facebook Messenger, iMessage, Skype, WhatsApp, etc.), and embedded content, always get *accurate* and *complete* information about your webpage content.

**Uses your *existing content* for meta tags and Schema markup:**

There's no need to manually re-enter descriptions, titles, product information, select images / videos, etc. &mdash; WPSSO Core reads your existing content automatically and offers fine-tuning and customization options for just about anything and everything. ;-)

WPSSO Core is language / locale aware, which means you can customize your site information, social page URLs and Knowledge Graph for different languages!

**Creates *accurate* and *complete* meta tags and Schema markup:**

WPSSO Core offers meta tags and Schema markup for Facebook / Open Graph, Google's Knowledge Graph and Rich Card SEO, Pinterest Rich Pins, Twitter Cards, Weibo and more &mdash; including complete image markup, video markup, extensive eCommerce product markup, author profile / authorship, co-authors, publisher information, local business markup, aggregate ratings, reviews, recipe information, event details, and much, much more &mdash; all from your existing content!

**Includes advanced *quality assurance* features and options:**

1. Checks for minimum / maximum image dimensions and aspect ratios.
2. Shows notices for missing and required images.
3. Verifies webpages for duplicate meta tags.
4. Validates theme header templates for correct HTML markup.
5. Checks and warns of any missing PHP modules.
6. Checks 3rd party plugin settings for possible conflicts.

**A reliable WordPress plugin for today *and* tomorrow:**

WPSSO Core is *extremely fast* and 100% compatible with the new <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/">Gutenberg block editor</a> in the upcoming release of WordPress v5.0.

<h3>Users Love the WPSSO Core Plugin</h3>

&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; &mdash; "The plugin is indispensable to me when it comes to posting on social media... it makes it so that your posts look the best that they possible can every time when posting on Facebook, Twitter, or any other site." - [monsuirette](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/this-is-probably-the-best-plugin-of-its-kind/)

&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; &mdash; "What a fantastic plugin. If you want to fix all the errors in search console for structured data, this is the plugin to use. Love it." - [goviral](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/makes-schema-so-easy/)

&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; &mdash; "This plugin saves me so much time, and it has really lifted my SERP rankings. Most of my keywords I now rank 1-3 position. I also noticed after about a week that my impressions have gone up at least 75%. I upgraded to the pro version which gave me even more options." - [playnstocks](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/excellent-plugin-and-support-200/)

&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; &mdash; "Yoast on steroids! As an SEO marketer, I love using Yoast for my basic on-page SEO. But Yoast only allows you to enter basic Open Graph social settings. This plugin gives you SO many more options on completing the Open Graph for Facebook, Twitter cards, Pinterest etc. If you use WordPress, I totally recommend using this plugin to help with better rankings in the SERPS!" - [gregmontag](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/yoast-on-steroids/)

**Version 4.16.6 (2010/11/17)**

* *New Features*
	* None.
* *Improvements*
	* None.
* *Bugfixes*
	* Fixed post, term, user options fallback in Free version.
* *Developer Notes*

**Version 4.16.5 (2010/11/14)**

* *New Features*
	* None.
* *Improvements*
	* Deprecated the redundant og:image:secure_url and og:video:secure_url meta tags. Image and video URLs are added as og:image and og:video - the og:image:url, og:image:secure_url, og:video:url, and og:video:secure_url are redundant meta tags that can be enabled in the SSO &gt; Advanced settings page. If your site serves content using both HTTP and HTTPS, then you may enable the og:image:secure_url and og:video:secure_url meta tags to include both HTTP and HTTPS URLs. Do not enable these meta tags if you redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS as this will only create unnecessary redundant requests.

	* Fixed duplicate variable names in the currency abbreviation / symbol lookup methods.
	* Fixed unnecessary type-casting in the WpssoSchema::organization_to_localbusiness() method argument to allow for mixed input (false or array).
* *Developer Notes*
	* None.
