== Description ==

<img class="readme-icon" src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso/assets/icon-256x256.png">

<p><strong>WPSSO uses <em>existing</em> content to generate meta tags + Schema markup</strong> &mdash; there's no need to manually enter / configure any additional settings or values, <em>but if you want to</em>, you can customize just about anything and everything. ;-)</p>

<p><strong>WPSSO creates <em>complete</em> and <em>accurate</em> meta tags + Schema markup</strong> &mdash; including hashtags, video seo, e-commerce products, author profile / authorship, co-authors, publisher information, ratings, event details, recipe information, and much more &mdash; all from your <em>existing</em> content.</p>

<p><strong>WPSSO provides special optimization features for Pinterest</strong> &mdash; offering customized Pinterest image sizes and preventing conflicts between incompatible Pinterest and Facebook / Open Graph meta tag values.</p>

<p><strong>WPSSO includes advanced <em>quality control</em> features and options</strong> &mdash; checking minimum / maximum image dimensions and aspect ratios, verifying the webpage for duplicate meta tags, showing notices for missing and required images, along with theme header template validation.</p>

<p><strong>WPSSO can enhance and integrate with your favorite SEO plugin!</strong> &mdash; WPSSO specializes in providing all the meta tags + Schema markup social sites and search engines need, and you can still continue to use your favorite SEO content / keyword analysis tools!</p>

<p><strong>WPSSO offers a <em>fast</em> and <em>reliable</em> social framework for developers</strong> &mdash; offering dozens of 3rd party integration modules in the Pro version, several Free and Pro extensions, and hundreds of filter hooks to easily customize WPSSO's behavior and output.</p>

New features are added, tested, and released incrementally, instead of grouping them together in a major version release. When minor bugs fixes and/or code improvements are applied, new versions are also released. This release schedule keeps the code stable and reliable, at the cost of more frequent updates.</p>
