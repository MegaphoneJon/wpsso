== Description ==

<img class="readme-icon" src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso/assets/icon-256x256.png">

**Automatically create complete meta tags and Schema markup from your content for Social Sharing (SMO), Google Rich Cards / Knowledge Graph (SEO), Pinterest Rich Pins, and many more.**

WPSSO Core creates complete and accurate meta tags and Schema markup for Facebook / Open Graph, Google Rich Cards / Knowledge Graph (SEO), Pinterest Rich Pins, Twitter Cards, and more &mdash; including descriptions, titles, hashtags, complete image markup, complete video markup, extensive eCommerce product markup, author profile / authorship, co-authors, publisher information, local business markup, aggregate ratings, reviews, recipe information, event details, and much, much more &mdash; all from your existing content.

**WPSSO Core uses your *existing content* for meta tags and Schema markup:**

There's no need to manually re-enter descriptions, titles, select images / videos, etc. WPSSO Core reads all of your existing WordPress content automatically &mdash; and if you want, you can also fine-tune and customize just about everything. ;-)

**WPSSO Core includes advanced *quality control* features and options:**

WPSSO Core checks for minimum / maximum image dimensions and aspect ratios, shows notices for missing and required images, verifies front-end webpages for duplicate meta tags, validates theme header templates for correct HTML markup, warns of any missing PHP modules, and inspects 3rd party plugin settings for possible conflicts.

**WPSSO Core offers special meta tags and features for Pinterest:**

WPSSO Core provides a specific image for the Pinterest Pin It button, excludes non-relevant images from being detected by Pinterest, and prevents conflicts between incompatible Pinterest and Facebook meta tag values.

**WPSSO Core can enhance and integrate with your favorite SEO plugin:**

WPSSO Core specializes in providing all the meta tags and Schema markup social sites and search engines need &mdash; and you can still continue to use your favorite SEO content / keyword analysis tools!

**WPSSO Core is *incredibly fast* and coded for performance:**

WPSSO Core and its add-ons make full use of all available caching techniques (persistent / non-persistent object and disk caching), and create cache objects in background to pre-seed the transient cache. WPSSO Core and its add-ons use only the PHP library files and object classes they need, keeping their code small, fast, and light. All code is fully tested and compatible with PHP v7.x (PHP v5.4 or better required).

**Advanced meta tag / JSON-LD markup filter hooks for developers:**

WPSSO Core offers hundreds of filter hooks to easily customize WPSSO Core's behavior and output, dozens of 3rd party integration modules in the Pro version, and several optional Free and Pro add-ons to extend WPSSO Core features.

<h3>Release Schedule</h3>

<p>New versions of the plugin are released approximately every week (more or less). New features are added, tested, and released incrementally, instead of grouping them together in a major version release. When minor bugs fixes and/or code improvements are applied, new versions are also released. This release schedule keeps the code stable and reliable, at the cost of more frequent updates.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often">release early, release often (RERO) software development philosophy</a> on Wikipedia for more information on the benefits of smaller / more frequent releases.</p>

<h3>Version Numbering</h3>

Version components: `{major}.{minor}.{bugfix}[-{stage}.{level}]`

* {major} = Major structural code changes / re-writes or incompatible API changes.
* {minor} = New functionality was added or improved in a backwards-compatible manner.
* {bugfix} = Backwards-compatible bug fixes or small improvements.
* {stage}.{level} = Pre-production release: dev < a (alpha) < b (beta) < rc (release candidate).

<h3>Free / Standard Version Repositories</h3>

* [GitHub](https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso/)
* [WordPress.org](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/wpsso/)

<h3>Development Updates for Pro Version</h3>

<p>Development, alpha, beta, and release candidate updates are available to WPSSO Core Pro version customers. Under the SSO &gt; Update Manager settings page, you can select the "Development and Up" version filter (for example) for the WPSSO Core plugin and all its add-ons (to satisfy any version dependencies). Save the plugin settings, and click the "Check for Updates" button to fetch the latest / current WPSSO Core version information. When new development versions are available, they can be installed under the Dashboard &gt; Updates page (like any other plugin update). You can also re-select the "Stable / Production" version filter at any time to re-install the last stable / production version of a plugin.</p>
